In this workshop, In-grid helped build new speculative plains through 3D tools such as Houdini, using it’s node structures to form webs of movements, digestions of matter, scattered and interwoven narratives of SF. George Simms took us through the basics of Houdini making a simple terrain scattered with objects, focusing on learning and creating with an adaptive and non-destructive process, allowing everything we build to be re-entwined and re-augmented for different objects or contexts. The session also briefly covered rendering through mantra so you will be able to have a finished outcome as well!

### What Do You Need?
Download Houdini, you can use the apprentice version for free and we won’t go outside of it’s limits. You will also want to download a HDRI, HDRI Haven does really nice free environment maps, just stick to roughly 4K resolution.
