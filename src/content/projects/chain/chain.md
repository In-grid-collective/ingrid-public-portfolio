title: Chain at Iklectik Art Lab
description: Testing the boundaries between live event and installation, In-grid created an evening of interaction and communion among strange devices, where we laid bare something of the fragile systems we are embedded in.

CHAIN confines echoes of unending, circular labour into an observable loop of digital processes. This feedback system works to pass on data: the machine does not ache and sweat where we might, and instead is obedient with its output. But nothing is perpetual or perfect: the system demands input, and is leaky, lossy; devouring and quickly forgetting the last gift of interaction offered to it. Models of hermetic processes break down on examination – nothing lasts forever and everything returns to rot. 

Chain was exhibited [at IKLECTIK](https://iklectikartlab.com/in-grid-chain/). In-grid brought a multi-format work into a performance space, interactive devices and data that communicated with IKLECTIK’s unique [AMOENUS soundsystem](https://amoenus.co.uk). 

Movement practitioner [Shai Rapoport](https://www.shairapoport.com/) and singer Christina Karpodini collaborated with devices during the event, becoming part of the system In-grid engineered: performers and attendees alike shaped the visual and sonic landscape in which they found themselves.
