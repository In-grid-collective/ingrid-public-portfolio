In-Wellness™ invited people to take part in our 90-minute cyber-welfare™ workshop. Our patented system of peer to peer sessions has been clinically* proven to increase mindfulness and decrease* the stresses of the empathy economy.

In order to take part in this revelatory process, we asked the participants to answer a quick questionnaire so we could create a sophisticated Emoto-Metric© that would personalize the experience. This was used to determine the candidate's suitability as well as their EMI™ (Emotional Manipulation Index), a non-linear scoring system that transposed how we navigated and understood everyone's health. With this affective metricization, we were truly In-Wellness™.
