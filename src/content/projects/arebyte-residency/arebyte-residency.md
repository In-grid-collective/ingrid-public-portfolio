We've included our original statement which reflects our position and concerns during this period. Although our residency began in June 2020 we were working to develop a programme and working relationship from 2019, and therefore the influence of Covid-19, lockdown, the political conditions in our home nations and the US, are woven through our work. 

In-grid has been developing as a collective since this point, and continues to evolve in relation to our guiding principles, membership and personal practices. We would like to acknowledge the support of Arebyte, Arts Council England and the Goldsmiths Computing department.
