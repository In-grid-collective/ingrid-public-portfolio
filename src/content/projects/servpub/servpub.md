## Servpub

ServPub is a project developing alternative platforms for research and practice on computational publishing, to reflect collectively on affective infrastructures, minor tech and autonomous networks within, and beyond, institutional constraints. In-grid was invited to collaborate on establishing and maintaining a network of servers on which to host publishing platforms, including [Wiki4print](https://wiki4print.servpub.net/) and [ci.servpub.net](https://ci.servpub.net/read).

ServPub is run by artists, coders, activists, collectives, scholars, researchers using FOSS, who share feminist values and practices. We aim to build shared knowledge and resources which operate at small scale and as part of grassroots community networks to explore alternatives. Participating communities/institutions include CSNI at LSBU, Creative Computing Institute at UAL, SHAPE at Aarhus University, In-grid, Systerserver, Varia and Creative Crowds.

We began this process with a series of workshops, during which we configured several nodes of a server network to establish our technical set up, and demonstrate our working methodologies in practice.

Workshop one: 
Creative Computing Institute,  UAL, 26th June, 2023, 12.00-17.00.

Setting up the initial servers of the two raspberry Pis with the collaborators at CCI for students.

Workshop two:
Centre for the Study of the Networked Image, 24th Novemeber, 2023, 13:00-17:00

During this workshop introduced ServPub as a project and as a network of technical and social components. We also took visitors through the technical setup of the node which now holds [Wiki4print](https://wiki4print.servpub.net/). We reflected on the process by wrapping up the day with a collective documentation exercise and group discussion with Q&A.

This workshop was facilitated by In-grid with contributions from Systerserver members.
