We interact with non-human entities more and more as our lives become further enmeshed with networks and interfaces. Chatbots act as a personal assistant when we shop, or as a financial advisor when we bank, and will possibly become omnipresent in our lives. In this livestream, Yasmin Morgan took us through the basics of how to code a simple chatbot using [Rivescript](https://www.rivescript.com/). You will learn how to create a knowledge base or a “brain” and explore some different ways of how the chatbot can interact with the user, such as using wildcards and topics. This will be a fun, relaxed session to demystify these elusive digital assistants and equip you with the tools to create chatbots.
    
### What Do You Need?

No coding knowledge is necessary as we will take you through the basics of Rivescript, which is simple enough to learn from scratch! However, some preliminary knowledge with Javascript is preferable as this will be our interpreter of choice. You can play with Rivescript directly on the browser but you can also can also install it as a module with node.js.

Note: this was a tutorial filmed a while ago, so for the latest instructions follow example code from [Rivescript](https://www.rivescript.com/)
