In-grid explored our first sub-theme of Alter Worlds with the help of Keiken. An open conversation and crit around the residency which focused on liveness and world building.

In-grid produced a number of live virtual events including a â€˜first birthday party', workshops, music, AV events and a virtual closing party. Keiken have produced a number of experimental events creating interesting dynamics with new technologies, so we invited the collective to share their experience as we developed our own live event concepts.

Keiken helped us kick off our development of a speculative narrative, exploring multi-channel storytelling, and creating a consistent and well-presented world. Shared processes and tools for building that helped In-grid shoot up and off into the cosmos!
