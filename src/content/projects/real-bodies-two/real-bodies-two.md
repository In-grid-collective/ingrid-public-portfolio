Clubs are refracted spaces, experienced by their visitors as serving a spectrum of functions. They are places to converge and meld bodies into dance monstrosities. They are the site of introspection, of a mindful hedonism, for an individual alone in a smoking area. Or else they are safe spaces, a room in which to comfortably self destruct.  

After the success of RealBodies at Corsica in May 2022, we decided to turn RealBodies into a series by continuing our exploration of experimental art*performance within club spaces. 

Real Bodies 2.0 was another evening of audio-visual experiments. With DJ sets from CSV, Solar Rocks, ler-ka, delirious.blanc and end measure. With visuals by Johanna De Verdier and Nate Townsend.
