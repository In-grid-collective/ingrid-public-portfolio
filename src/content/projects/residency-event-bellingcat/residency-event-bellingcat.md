Bellingcat: Locating data in time and space
June 23, 2020 
Bellingcat, Investigating Data
June 17, 2020 

In-grid explored our third sub-theme of Shifting Chronology over two sessions with the help of Bellingcat, an independent international collective of researchers, investigators and citizen journalists using open source and social media investigation to probe a variety of subjects â€“ including tracking the use of chemical weapons and conflicts worldwide. With staff and contributors in more than 20 countries around the world, we operated in a unique field where advanced technology, forensic research, journalism, investigations, transparency and accountability come together.
Nick Waters, Bellingcat contributor, shared some of the techniques he uses for his investigative reporting.
