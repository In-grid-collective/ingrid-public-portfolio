‘Losing the Plot’ is an exhibition from In-grid. The exhibition will feature artworks which explore concepts around history and lore: looking into archival and record keeping practices, unreliable narrators and oral histories, changelogs and other technological timestamps. Taking a playful while careful approach, the work shown will consider the social and technical mechanisms of record keeping, categorisation and labelling. We will consider where power and bias lie when keeping, updating or writing into records, and different orientations of measuring the passage of time.
The exhibition itself will be mutable, a living archive which will be in flux during its run via public activations, performative moments and amendments from In-grid as artist*archivists. By creating our own technological infrastructures, archival protocols and games within the space we hope to imagine ways of working with archives that are awkward and unruly – creating space for ideas which can’t be filed away neatly.
