As part of 'EASST-4S 2024 Amsterdam: Making and Doing Transformations' ci.servpub.net is a federated repository for the Collective Infrastructures panel. It focuses on experiences and practices that counter or subvert digital infrastructures that are characterised by the “Cloud”. We look to how collectives and communities are making transformations in infrastructures as system admins, community organisers and practitioner groups, forming protocols and ways of doing otherwise.
    
In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/educators/technologists working in and around digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people dispersed globally. Visit in-grid.io to learn more about what we do.
