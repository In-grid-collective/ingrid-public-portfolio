On the 24 September 2022, in-grid collective hosted an after party for [Toppling](https://www.artrabbit.com/events/toppling-set-woolwich), a group exhibition organised by SET Woolwich studio residents, as a celebration to mark the end of the programme and a response to the building itself. Following the success of the inaugural [Real Bodies 1.0](https://in-grid-collective.github.io/ingrid-public-portfolio/projects/real-bodies-one/) event we were asked to close the residency by curating an evening of DJ sets, perfomances, wearables and live visuals. This night explored both audiovisual collaboration between the artists and the transmutational potential of party spaces.
