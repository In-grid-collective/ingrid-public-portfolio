In-grid explored our fourth face of Liminal Touch with the help of Maggie Roberts, a member of the 0rphan Drift collaboration. Their practice explores different modes of collaboration and how it could be expanded to the non human. Orphan Drift was working with Etic Lab, asking what it might mean to communicate with an Alien Intelligence and how might we try to do it? Involving direct encounters with cephalopods and collaborative explorations with Machine Learning engineers, VR designers and teuthologists. During this session we looked predominantly into the two following areas:

# Collaboration

In-grid has used a number of platforms to form over, places to merge thoughts, feelings and ideas, but how can they re-imagine they’re elements converging, collecting and filtering? What constitutes collaboration and how is In-grid forming through it?

# Dispersed Archive/Conscious

In-grid was collecting memories, transient thoughts and conversations from all it’s members, compiling a recollection, a conscious of its own creation. In-grid was looking for ways to keep this dispersed network of interactions decentralized and non-linear, an archive that reflects In-grids conception and formation.
