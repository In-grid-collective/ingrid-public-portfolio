    In-grid has made infrastructures, thrown parties, created artworks, written docs/fictions/frameworks and facilitated events and conversations with other creative practitioners.

    Our multidisciplinary practice spans computing, data visualisation, audiovisual performance, DIY electronics, networked experiences, human-machine collaboration and more. We interrogate digital labour and technological systems while embracing collective practices and knowledge sharing.
