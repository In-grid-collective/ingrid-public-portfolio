    In-grid has made infrastructures, thrown parties, created artworks, written docs/fictions/frameworks and facilitated events and conversations with other creative practitioners.

    Our multidisciplinary practice spans computing, data visualisation, audiovisual performance, DIY electronics, networked experiences, human-machine collaboration and more. We interrogate digital labour and technological systems while embracing collective practices and knowledge sharing.

    In-grid's web infrastructure is hosted with [servus.at](https://core.servus.at/). Read our [femfester](https://femfester.in-grid.io/), a contribution included in [Artists Running Data Centers](https://monoskop.org/images/b/bf/Artists_Running_Data_Centers_2024.pdf) which was published by servus.
