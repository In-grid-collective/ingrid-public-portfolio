# Who We Are 

In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/educators/technologists working in and around digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people dispersed globally.

# What we do 

In-grid has made infrastructures, thrown parties, created artworks, written docs/fictions/frameworks and facilitated events and conversations with other creative practitioners.

Our multidisciplinary practice spans computing, data visualisation, audiovisual performance, DIY electronics, networked experiences, human-machine collaboration and more. We interrogate digital labour and technological systems while embracing collective practices and knowledge sharing.
